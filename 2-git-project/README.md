INITIALIZING A REPOSITORY AND MAKING COMMITS
WHAT IS GIT?
Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes made in your code. It also helps you collaborate with other developer. Before Git, there were other technologies available that solves this problem and a good example is SVN. Git adopted a differench approach from that of SVN which allows developers to make their copies of the central repository, and that is why it is referred to as a Distributed Version Control System.

INITIALIZING A GIT REPOSITORY
Before we can initialize a git repository, we must have installed git on our computer. After installing, to initialize a repo. We follow the below steps;

We open a terminal on our computer e.g Git bash; the default terminal after downloading and installing Git.

We open the terminal and create a working folder or directory e.g DevOps folder using this command mkdir DevOps.

After creating the folder or directory, we'll have to change or move into the working directory using this command cd DevOps.

While inside the folder/directory, we use the git init command to initialize our repository.
